    Nobody knows Just why we're here Could it be fate Or random circumstance At the right place At the right time Two roads intertwine And if the universe conspired To meld our lives To make us
    Fuel and fire Then know Where ever you will be So too shall I be Close your eyes Dry your tears 'Coz when nothing seems clear You'll be safe here From the sheer weight Of your doubts and fears 
    Weary heart You'll be safe here Remember how we laughed Until we cried At the most stupid things Like we were so high But love was all that we were on We belong And though the world would
    Never understand This unlikely union And why it still stands Someday we will be set free. Pray and believe When the light disappears And when this world's insincere You'll be safe here
    When nobody hears you scream I'll scream with you You'll be safe here Save your eyes From your tears When everything's unclear You'll be safe here From the sheer weight Of your doubts and fears
    Wounded heart When the light disappears And when this world's insincere You'll be safe here When nobody hears you scream I'll scream with you You'll be safe here In my arms Through the long cold night
    Sleep tight You'll be safe here When no one understands I'll believe You'll be safe,You'll be safe You'll be safe here Put your heart in my hands You'll be safe here. Wari'y nilikha Upang buhayin ang
    pag-irog ko sa'yo Oh sa iyo Kundiman ang siyang duduyan sa sarili mong mundo Mong mundo Sa'yo na lang ako humihiling Sana sa'kin ka na mahumaling Ikaw lang naman ang gusto kong kapiling
    Ang puso kong ito'y sayong sayo Hinding hindi ako malilito Kapag tumitingin ka na sa akin Mundo ko'y humihinto Oh malumanay Aking pag-ibig sa iyo oh Sa iyo Oh inaalay Ang aking tinig sa iyo
    Sa iyo lamang Oh kay banayad kung iisipin Nananabik ako sa'yong lambing Nagpapasimple lamang Ang pusong ito'y sabik na at Sa'yo lang ang tingin at pagtingin Proseso ng dasal at pag hiling
    Ikaw lang naman ang gusto kong kapiling Ang oras ay hindi humihinto Pag-ibig ay hindi maglalaho Kapag tumitingin ka na sa akin Mundo ko'y iyong iyo Oh malumanay Aking pag-ibig sa iyo oh
    Sa iyo Oh inaalay Ang aking tinig sa iyo Sa iyo lamang Tingin, tingin, tingin Oh mawala ka man sa'kin Kailan muli madarama ang halik sa takipsilim Oh malumanay Aking pag-ibig sa iyo oh
    Sa iyo Oh inaalay Ang aking tinig sa iyo Sa iyo lamang. Pains of the past Make for a guarded heart But he saw her light And walked right in It felt familiar, felt like home With a broom in his hand
    He swept her off her feet Lonely days and nights Have long been gone What once was lost Has now been found Like the stars to the dreamers Like the sea to the shore With a hand to hold 
    The future has been toldAnd she said It's the right time To fall in love again It's the right time To be loved again It's the right time To feel this way again It's the right time, it's the right time
    Once in a while We meet someone who'll stay And lifts us upTo heights we never knew We share the saddest of sorrows And never feel alone Ever again So we say It's the right time To fall in love again
    It's the right time To be loved againIt's the right time To feel this way again It's the right time, it's the right time It's the right time To say yes to this It's the right time
    To give in to this blissIt's the right timeIt's never lateHearts won't breakTime won't fade a love like this Time won't fade a love like this. Hindi man araw-araw na nakangiti Ilang beses na rin tayong 
    humihindi 'Di na mabilang ang ating mga tampuhan Away-bati natin, 'di na namamalayan Eto tayo Ngunit sa huli, palagi Babalik pa rin sa yakap mo Hanggang sa huli, palagi Pipiliin kong maging sa 'yo 
    Ulit-ulitin man Nais kong malaman mong iyo ako palagi Palagi Kung balikan man ang hirap, luha't lahat Ikaw ang paborito kong desisyon at'Pag napaligiran ng ingay at ng gulo 'Di ko 'pagpapalit ngiti

    know just how much you mean to me. From the moment I met you, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile, your laughter, the way your eyes light up when you talk about the things you love -
